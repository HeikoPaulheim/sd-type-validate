# sd-type-validate
Code for the SDType and SDValidate algorithms for type completion and error detection in RDF knowledge bases.

The code is executed by invoking the Runner class. 

Make sure you have downloaded the mapping based types, mapping based properties, and disambiguations from DBpedia, and adjust the paths in the Runner class accordingly.
